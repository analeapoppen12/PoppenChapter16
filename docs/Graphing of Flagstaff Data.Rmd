## Question 1

Create a new directory in your package called docs/. In that directory create a RMarkdown file that loads your package and uses the weather data to make a few graphs of weather phenomena over time.

```{r}
data("Flagstaff_Weather")
print(Flagstaff_Weather)
```


```{r}
ggplot(Flagstaff_Weather, aes(x=DATE, y=SNOW)) +
  geom_line()
ggplot(Flagstaff_Weather, aes(x=DATE, y=TMAX)) +
  geom_point()
```
